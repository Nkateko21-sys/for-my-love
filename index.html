        <p>
          I love you for so many reasons, some small and silly, others deep and hard to explain.
          I love that you‚Äôre a little weird ‚Äî in the most wonderful way ‚Äî the way you make the world feel less serious and more fun. 
          Your music taste always surprises me; it's like hearing your personality in sound.
          I find myself smiling every time you share a song. I love your smile too ‚Äî it‚Äôs contagious and comforting, 
          like a light I didn't know I needed. I love your patience with me, even when I don‚Äôt deserve it, and how you always try to understand me, even when I‚Äôm being difficult. I love that you insult me in the most playful, affectionate way ‚Äî it‚Äôs our own little love language, and no one else would ever get it. You see me in ways no one else does, and somehow still choose to stay. That kind of love ‚Äî your kind of love ‚Äî is rare, and I treasure it every single day.

        <p>
          I choose you because when I picture my future, you're the one I want by my side ‚Äî not just as my partner,
          but as the mother of my kids. I know you'd be an incredible mom: nurturing, strong, kind, and full of heart. 
          I‚Äôve seen how deeply you care, how effortlessly you give, and how much warmth you bring to me.
          You're smart in a way that challenges me to grow, humble in a way that makes others feel safe, and caring in a way that‚Äôs 
          truly rare. You bring calm to my chaos, laughter to my silence, and direction when I feel lost. 
          I choose you because no one else makes me feel the way you do ‚Äî seen, loved, understood. You make love feel easy,
          and you make life feel like something I want to build ‚Äî with you, and only you.
